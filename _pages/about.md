Welcome! I'm Leanna, and I'm a public health scientist interested in improving the uptake of research evidence into health research and policy. The bulk of my career has focused on studying substance use and substance use disorders, with current projects focusing on (1) linguistic correlates of research use in state-level substance use legislation and (2) the representation of older adults in substance use research. I hold a master's degree in behavioral neuroscience and am nearly finished with an additional master's degree in public health, both from the University at Buffalo. I intend to further my education by entering a PhD program in health policy in Fall 2025.

A second, and equally exciting, area of my research and service is getting more scientists involved in civic engagement, such as through science policy, advocacy, and diplomacy. To this end, I am currently the Civic Science Fellow in Neuroscience and AI at Neuromatch, where I study strategies for how to get more computational scientists to incorporate these practices into their research. I also serve as the VP of External Relations at Science & Policy Exchange, where I develop partnerships with Canadian-based science policy organizations and student groups. Prior to this, I worked at organizations such as the National Science Policy Network and Scholars Strategy Network to develop and implement training programs for scientists interested in growing their skillsets and networks to engage in this work. 

Outside of my work, I enjoy staying active through reformer pilates and indoor cycling classes. I am also an avid Buffalo sports fan and live in Southern Ontario with my husband and three cats.
